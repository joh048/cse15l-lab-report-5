Hi. I am working on this RomanToInt program that takes a string input which represents a roman numeral and returns the corresponding number as an integer. When I ran my JUnit tests 2 of them succeeded, one of which for testing "X" and the other for testing "VI". However, I somehow got a test wrong for "MXCIV" and I'm not really sure why. When debugging this issue, I figured that maybe it could have been the for loop not looping through the string correctly or maybe the calculations of the numbers being wrong. Could I get some help on this please?
